# Project Requirements:

1.  Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at 
    least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
2.   Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
      * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
      * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
      * A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to 
        visualization (must be approved) 
3.   Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4.   Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5.   Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, 
     and textboxes.
6.   If possible, your final visualization should include at least three views.
