# Project Requirements:

1.  Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at 
    least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
2.   Your project should fall into one of the below tracks:
      * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
      * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
      * A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to 
        visualization (must be approved) 
3.   Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4.   Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5.   Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, 
     and textboxes.
6.   If possible, your final visualization should include at least three views.

# Inspiration

The launching point of this project was inspired by taking an actual project proposed to a group members's employer and seeing if we could present the data interactively and visually. The anonymized data provided was meant to only be dissected _____________________, and we wanted to show that it could be presented in a much better way.

# Project Description

The application is a data visualization tool for energy usage data. It fetches data from a backend API and displays the information using different types of charts, such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots. The data can be filtered by year (2021, 2022, 2023), location, and utility types (Water, Gas, and Electric) using dropdown menus. The goal is for the user to be able to visually find trends in the data so that they can present to their client areas that need attention for purposes of 





This is an important part of your project and what many developers and non-developers will look at. It is vital to have the most accurate and correct information. The description needs to be well written with no grammar errors and that is readable to users of multiple backgrounds. It is important to put some time and thought into writing the description of the project. It does not need to be long but needs to summarize the project. (What does your app do? What tech did you use?)
